# To Do app
Project built on Node.js with Express serving the HTML via handlebars templating.

I built this with node v0.12.7 and npm v2.11.3

To run this project you'll need to clone the repo:
`git clone https://github.com/geeksmarter/todo`

Enter the project and install dependencies:
`cd todo && npm install`

Run the project:
`npm start`

Finally navigate to:
`http://localhost:3000`

Everything important is in the `public/` and `views/` directories.
